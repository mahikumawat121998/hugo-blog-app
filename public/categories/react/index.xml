      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two popular frameworks, Next.js and Express, serve different features and purposes. In this blog post, we will explore the differences between Next.js and Express and discuss when and why you might choose one over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;purpose-os-nextjs&#34;&gt;Purpose os Next.js&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of React, focusing on server-rendered and statically generated React applications. It provides a structure for building complex, dynamic web applications and offers features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG). These features enhance performance, improve SEO, and provide faster initial page loads. On top of that, Next.js has a built-in API routing system that allows creating API endpoints securely connecting with third-party services and consuming from the front end. It can also use serverless functions and edge network deployment to build scalable APIs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; Hook is a fundamental aspect of React that allows developers to handle side effects in functional components. Introduced in React 16.8, it replaces the need for class-based lifecycle methods, enabling a more streamlined approach to managing side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In functional components, side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or affect the component outside of rendering, such as fetching data from an API, setting up a subscription, or manually manipulating the DOM. The &lt;code&gt;useEffect&lt;/code&gt; Hook provides a way to perform these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
